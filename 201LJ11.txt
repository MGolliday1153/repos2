Darik's Boot And Nuke (DBAN) is an entirely free data destruction program used to completely erase all the files on a hard drive.
This includes everythingâ€”every installed application, all your personal files, and even the operating system.
DBAN has to run while the operating system isn't in use so you'll need to burn the program to a disc (CD, DVD, USB) and run it from there.
