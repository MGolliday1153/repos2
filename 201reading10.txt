VeeamZIP delivers technology that lets you create backups of running VMs. With VeeamZIP, you have to specify only two things – the VM you want to backup and where your resulting backup file will go. It’s that easy! The backup will be deduplicated (within the single VM being backed up) and compressed, resulting in significantly lower backup storage requirements. Many people ask what benefit this will provide in terms of disk space when only a single VM is involved, when I use VeeamZIP on a single VM; the disk savings are usually about half that of the VM’s actual usage on disk.  The figure below shows a VeeamZIP ad-hoc backup being started:
Restoring VM files (.vmdk, .vmx and others for VMware; .vhd, .vhdx, .xml and others for Hyper-V). Veeam Backup Free restores VM files directly from deduplicated, compressed backups without having to extract the VM from the backup.
Restoring an entire VM. You can restore an entire VM to the same location or to a new location.
Restoring VM disks (VMware). If a VM disk becomes corrupted by an OS failure or some other cause, you can simply restore the affected VM disk and connect it to the original or recovered VM.
Restoring guest OS files. You can restore guest OS files for Windows FAT and NTFS file systems, and also ReFS with OS-level deduplication when running Windows Server 2012. Moreover, a special wizard and a virtual helper appliance provide support for 17 additional file systems. In all cases, Veeam Backup Free Edition is able to restore the guest files without having to extract the entire virtual disk image from the backup.
